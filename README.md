# Blinky

Blinky is a rudimental webpage intended as a sort of "link-in-bio" style landing page to point visitors to other places on the web.

_Currently it's fairly hard-coded to my preferences, but there will be some effort to make things a little more easily modifiable._

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) will display the output page, auto-updating.
